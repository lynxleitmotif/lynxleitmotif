## Pre-Games

#### Day 1:
The reaping occurs in each District on October 1st at three o’clock p.m. The children are separated into age groups with the adults in the back. The Mentor, the Mayor, and a security force are the only ones on stage. The promotional video is played, and then the Mentor picks the name of one tribute out of a glass bowl. The chosen tribute proceeds to the stage, and an opportunity for volunteers is given. (NOTE: If it is the start of a decade year \[10, 20, 30, etc.], there will be two tributes chosen from each District instead of the usual one. If it is a Quarter Quell \[25, 50, 75, etc.], there will be four tributes chosen from each District instead of the usual one.)

After the tribute choice is finalized, the tribute is given one hour to say goodbye to family and friends, and then they board the train to the Capitol along with the Mentor and the Escort. Mentors often choose this time to review the reapings with their tribute and discuss branding ideas and strategy. 

The Training Centre is a building split into two wings, each connected by a bridge to the Victor’s Tower. Wing One serves as the tribute’s quarters. It has twelve floors which house each tribute and their entourage (mentor, stylist, and escort). District One resides on Floor 1, District Two on Floor 2, etcetera. Wing Two holds the training rooms and interview studios, as well as temporary quarters for the head trainer, Gamemakers, and the interview host.

When the tribute arrives at the Training Centre, the tribute is greeted and cleaned up by their stylist team, then given a meal and shown their room. The rest of the day is spent freely, however they must remain on their floor.

#### Day 2:
The stylists spend most of the morning consulting the Mentor and preparing the tributes for the Opening Ceremony, which occurs at noon. It consists of the tributes parading around a large track in chariots. It serves as a general introduction to the public, as well as the Gamemakers and the President. 

Afterwards, the tributes are given a communal meal. They are then allowed access to the training room which is introduced to them by the head trainer. They can either spend the rest of the day in the training room or return to their quarters to discuss strategy with their mentors. Many mentors take advantage of this time to discuss training strengths and begin preparing for the interviews.

#### Day 3: 
In the morning, the tributes are free to train throughout the day. The mentors are allowed to watch from an enclosed balcony, but are not allowed to directly interact. In the afternoon, the mentors are called into the studio to be interviewed on their tribute. This footage is not shown to the tributes nor is it shown to other mentors, as not to reveal secrets that could change the odds. This day is free choice for the tributes, but the training room closes at eight o’clock at night.

#### Day 4: 
This day is spent doing further training and discussing their brand with the Mentor and the stylist team. In the evening, the tributes are made up by their stylists, who have created an outfit they think fits the aspiring brand of the tribute. At six o’clock in the evening, the tributes are brought to the studio and interviewed, beginning with District One and ending with District 12. This is their first real introduction to the public. During the show, the mentors along with the elite of the Capitol hold a gala to watch the interviews. Mentors begin to pick up sponsors during this time.

#### Day 5: 
In the afternoon, the tributes present their skills to the Gamemakers to receive their training scores, beginning with District One and ending with District 12. The scores are announced in the evening. They rank the tributes from one (the worst) to twelve (the best). They severely impact audience and sponsor support.

#### Day 6: 
This is the day of the Naming Ceremony. During this ceremony, the tributes choose a name for themselves that will be displayed above their heads during the games. They are brought into the interview studio, given a chance to explain the backstory and/or reasoning behind their chosen name, and then type their name into the system for clarification on capital letters and spelling. This day is usually spent as a last-ditch attempt to gather sponsors by the Mentors. They make sure the tribute knows what sort of persona they hold and solidify their name.

#### Day 7:
The Hunger Games begin!

## Post-Games
After the winning tribute is taken out of the Arena, they are sequestered in the Training Centre to recover. This is mainly to avoid any public breakdowns, allow doctors to fix most of their injuries, and give the Mentors time to coach their tribute on what to do from here on out. The previous Victors from the current floor are interviewed on their thoughts about their new floormate. If more time is needed for recovery, a recap and analysis of the new Victor’s Games is presented until they are fit for public view.

#### Day 1:
The first full day after the Victor has recovered, they are dressed in an outfit their stylist chooses, usually harkening back to their time in the Arena and are interviewed about their experiences. This interview serves as the Victory Tour stop in the Capitol.

#### Days 2 - 12:
The Victor then embarks on their Victory Tour, stopping in one District per day (excluding their home district) and beginning in District 1 (or 2, if they are from 1). The Victory Tour consists of what is usually a pre-written speech about how thankful the Victor is to have won and how grateful they are for the support of the districts. It is decreasingly well- received the further down the Districts they go.

#### Day 14:
The Victory Tour ends in the Victor’s home district. After the ceremony, they are given one hour to see their family and friends and collect whatever belongings they wish to take with them to the Victor’s Tower. The family of the Victor is given a house in the Victor’s Village, and the assurance of more than enough money and food from the Capitol for their child’s Victory. The Victor boards the train in the evening and rides back to the Capitol. 

#### Day 15: 
The Victor moves into their floor in the Victor’s Tower and is informally welcomed by the first tribute of the decade.

#### Day 16: 
The stylist visits the tributes and dresses up the tribute for the Victor’s Welcome, a gala in which the Victor makes a speech about how excited they are for this “next step” and the other floor residents make introductory announcements. It is attended by the elite of the Capitol and broadcast through Panem.
