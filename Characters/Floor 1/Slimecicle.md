# Slimecicle - 14

## Personal Information
**Name:** Charlie Greenfield /j
**Birth Date:** August 12, -4
**Age at Victory:** 17
**District:** [[District 7]]
**Career**: No
**Volunteer:** Yes
**Token:** wooden die \[with indeterminate number of sides] on a string necklace
**Pre-Games:** has a close-knit \[vague and indeterminate] group of friends, and is generally well-liked because he’s charlie fucking slimecicle. He’s already involved in his district’s industry, so he knows how to handle an axe and climb a tree and haul heavy things around

## Introduction Week
**Reaping:** Volunteers in the place of a \[vague and unnamed] friend, breaking their pact to never volunteer should one of them be chosen
**Costuming:** i think THAT INCORPORATING SOME OF HIS JRWI DESIGNS WOULD BE COOL (wood elf boy with pointed ears and green hair and the br’aad sash)
**Training Score/Total Tributes:** 10/12 this man is ripped and smart as hell
**Public Reception:** Refuses to choose an arena name. He’s liked by the public, but the Capitol ensures he’s perceived as oblivious and harmless (despite the fact that his game score marks him as a threat) to cover up the intentions behind that action as much as possible. If they don’t say anything, it doesn’t mean anything.

## The Arena
there’s. Plants (this is so funny) Charlie hides in the trees to listen in on other tributes’ conversations and strategies. also there’s. slime involved (IT ONLY GETS FUNNIER)
Slime mutts capable of disguising themselves as part of the terrain roam the arena. They can’t be hurt with traditional weapons, as they just split into multiple parts and continue attacking, which only increases their danger in the long term. However, Charlie’s able to recognize the disguised slimes due to his experience in nature, and also figures out that they can be permanently killed using corrosive sap from inside the arena’s trees.

## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** three days, acid damage on his skin is healed completely
**Costuming:** uh oh. They shove the slime mutts from his arena onto his brand, drawing on the similarities between their camouflaging ability and Charlie’s hiding strategy, and dial up the “guy who doesn’t know anything” aspect of his persona up to eleven, to the extent that now he’s not even human anymore 
**Public Reception:** still liked, but in public he pushes his real personality down and fully gets into character. He’s just a funny guy. His refusal to choose an arena name, combined with Karl’s actions in the previous games, is what spurs on the implementation of the mentorship system.

## The Tower
**Relationship with District:** generally positive. Charlie keeps his values from home close to his chest, doesn’t commercialize them or betray them, and district seven respects that. Once district visitation starts, he’s gladly welcomed back by his \[vague and unnamed] friends every year. 

**Relationship with Floormates: **
- Overall: Friend
- Techno:
- [[The_Eret]]: Charlie instinctively looks to Eret as an authority figure, since she’s the only person on the floor who’s actually older than him, even though technically Techno’s in charge and Eret doesn’t really want that responsibility
- [[CaptainPuffy]]: Probably his closest friend on f1? They bond over being the two people on the floor most eager to properly make friends with everyone else - and, frankly, for a lack of better options at the time, since everyone else is so closed off. They pick up on the traditions of each other’s districts, and try to form a more stable emotional core for the rest of f1 where Techno and Eret didn’t succeed
- Karl: 
- Ant: 
- [[Ranboo]]: they are Friends. Charlie acts as a protective older brother figure towards Ranboo (who arrives at the tower at a whopping 12 years old) and overall tries to be a reliable adult figure in his life as he grows up. Ranboo picks up Charlie’s sense of humor over time
- [[Thunder1408]]: Jack is a little bewildered by everything that Charlie is and does at first, but they get along well. Charlie learns to make musical instruments for him, and they bond over the circumstances of their volunteering (protecting someone they care about against that person’s wishes). Eventually they form something of a trio with Foolish.
- [[ConnorEatsPants]]: Connor keeps to himself, but Charlie drags him into group activities and tries to make sure he doesn’t just stay cooped up in his room all day. Connor’s a little bewildered by his energy, but eventually goes along with it, even if he rolls his eyes at him in a fond way. Connor also recognizes the way Charlie’s being suppressed by the Capitol and his own persona
- [[FoolishGamers]]: they can bond over. being ripped I guess. using the f1 gym together, spotting each other for weightlifting, being jock shaped friends that were reduced to a very one-dimensional persona,,, in short, they are bros. Foolish laughs at Charlie's jokes, and their districts share a lot of values so that contributes to how well they get along. 

**Interfloor Relationships: **
- [[jschlatt]]: during Charlie’s games, Schlatt sees through the funny oblivious guy persona to Charlie’s actual skill and determination - he knows he’s smarter than they let him be and sees his refusal to choose a name for what it is, and he respects it. They end up actually getting along and become friends, somehow. Charlie gets to break out of his standard persona for a bit and just yell over Schlatt about some dumb topic for minutes at a time, and it’s therapeutic for both of them
- [[Quackity]]: They get along well. Charlie’s kind of protective of Quackity - he wants to make sure Quackity can realize he’s safe in this environment and that he can trust him
- [[Purpled]]: the guy makes him feel uneasy for. uh. no particular reason

**Personal Development:** 
- Initially, trying to figure out the mess of dynamics he’s landed in the middle of on f1, and befriending the people he’s gonna live with for the rest of his life in true district seven fashion. He succeeds.
- Later on, he offers [[Sapnap]] the strategy of channeling his anger into his brand during his own games. Sapnap wins, but he does so by burning down a forest in his arena, destroying his token, leaving him with permanent burn scars, and damaging his relationship with district seven. Charlie feels responsible for this, seeing his strategy as the reason for those events. Sapnap doesn’t blame him, but Charlie himself sure does

## As of Year 28
**Mentee:** [[Sapnap]]
**Costuming:** slime. silly guy who knows nothing and has seen empires rise and fall. Himbo
**Public Perception:** Still seen as that funny and oblivious guy he was branded as in 14. Most likely has started fading out of popularity once Sapnap takes over as the d7 mentor. who is this guy lmao? august 12th? that’s dream’s birthday, what about it?
**Current Arc/Issue:** There may still be some lingering guilt over Sapnap’s games, but I’d say he’s generally well-adjusted by now

## Other
