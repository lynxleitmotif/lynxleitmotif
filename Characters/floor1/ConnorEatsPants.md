## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** 

**Relationship with Mentor:** Callahan is happy Connor won but is struggling with the fact that Connor isn’t rebelling with silence. There are arguments on the tour where Connor is yelling and then Callahan just puts his hands in his pockets and walks away. And. what the fuck. It just ends the convo. They eventually reconcile when 8 is not quiet at the victory stop and Callahan realizes that silence isn’t an option that truly works for 8 anymore. There's a learning curve and an uphill battle with that where neither of them change but they get more comfortable with each other. Then they are friends with each other.
