## The Arena
Islands split apart by deep expanses of water, main method of getting around the Arena is makeshift watercraft. The Careers step off the podium early, surprising the Gamemakers and gaining an unfair advantage over the other tributes. Puffy allies herself with the District 4 tribute, and after their death she takes what they taught her about navigating the water to hunt down the people who killed them, securing her victory.
