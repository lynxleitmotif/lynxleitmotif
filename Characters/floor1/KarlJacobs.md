## Introduction Week
**Reaping:** 

**Costuming:** 

**Training Score/Total Tributes:** 4/12

**Public Reception:** Names himself his real, full name. This is an insult to District 6 and its values, and they disapprove of his choice. He markets himself as a young kid who doesn’t quite know what’s going on, putting himself in the hearts of the Capitol as a tragically hopeful underdog.

## The Arena
The Arena clothes the tributes are given glow a variety of bright colors in the dark. A little less than half of the tributes immediately step off of the platform before the countdown is over, thinking they could get a head start like last year. However, everyone who steps off the platform early dies, as the Gamemakers included land mines under the platforms to ensure no one would cheat. Throughout the Game, every six hours all light in the Arena disappears for two hours, and various monsters will roam the area in specific patterns. Karl is able to time the blackouts and “miraculously” foresee the patterns of the monsters, avoiding getting caught. He wins after everyone else fails to figure out the pattern. In reality, he had managed to get information about the Game from one of the head Gamemakers before entering the Arena, therefore knowing the patterns already.

## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** 

**Costuming:** 

**Public Reception:** His real method for winning is kept under wraps and seemingly Karl gets off with no consequence, but the Capitol and Gamemakers punish him for it in the long term. The public is enamored with him and his seemingly supernatural ability. He’s branded as an all-knowing, all-present being, often clothed in the blocky glow in the dark colors of his Arena clothes.
