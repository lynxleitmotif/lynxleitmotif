# FoolishGamers - 19

## Personal Information
**Name:** Foolish

**Birth Date:** December 18, 1

**Age at Victory:** 18

**District:** [4](district4.md)

**Career:** Yes

**Volunteer:** Yes

**Mentor:** [Nihachu](../floor0/Nihachu.md)

**Token:** None

**Pre-Games:** Foolish is the son of the District 4 senator. He trains in the Career Program, but attempts to keep himself under the radar. He doesn’t plan to try and be chosen to participate in the Games, rather using the program as something that will look good on his resume if he chooses to pursue higher education or a job in the Capitol.
 
## Introduction Week
**Reaping:** Against his wishes, the head of Four’s Career Program puts him in the roster to volunteer in his last year in the Program. Dropping out would smear his mother’s reputation and hurt the status of his family, so he reluctantly accepts. 

**Relationship with Mentor:** they are very close i think. She teaches him basic strategy from her games and other games she's watched, both strategy for in the games and before them. They are the only D4 tributes so far. Niki feels sorry for him since he had to volunteer but she also thinks that he’s the first district 4 tribute since her to have an actual chance. She makes sure he is branded as both powerful and likeable and that he plays up the reluctant career so the capital likes his story. Foolish is very grateful for Niki’s help and he generally trusts her guidance.

**Costuming:** he’s costumed as a shark or other carnivorous fish. Fins, scales, teeth, etc. also costumes to show off his buff-ness bc man’s a career. Also uses a little bit of his like “noble birth” i guess to play him off as a more powerful tribute i guess. Shown to be like,, well put together and likeable but also dangerous if you get on his bad side.

**Training Score/Total Tributes:** 12/12

**Public Reception:** one of the capital’s favorites. Liked by his district but not a lot of the others. With Niki’s guidance, he plays up the reluctant career story. He highlights that he volunteered for his family and peppers in that he feels like he had more of a chance than the other tribute, so he wanted to help them. Also plays up his likeability and his personality. He is very “sunshine boy with a dark side” in the eyes of the capital. District 4 generally likes him bc he’s their tribute and they see him as the first tribute in a while who has an actual chance. Uses a lot of fish/ocean metaphors in bios or interviews. Labeled as ‘The Shark of D4’ going into the games. He’s also shown to be more polite/put together than the other tributes bc of his family. The Capital likes this, the districts like it less. (districts see it as the capital trying to claim Foolish for their own). The other districts don’t like him as much. They don’t hate him, but he is the #1 ranked tribute and rightfully so, so they're a little disgruntled.

## The Arena
An ancient Egypt-like desert, complete with ruined pyramids and raging river. Foolish is able to survive fairly easily using the river and his swimming abilities to his advantage, most of the other tributes dying from heat exhaustion or dehydration. In the final battle, the other tribute holds his head underwater, and he tricks them into thinking he’s drowned. When they relax, he breaches the surface, overwhelms them and secures his victory. 
A lot of footage from the beginning of the games is focused on him, since he’s most people’s bet to win the games. All he does at the beginning is grab some stuff from the Cornucopia and bolt to the river; he doesn’t kill anyone on the first day or form any alliances. When the capital realizes that he’s not doing much more than trying to survive, they focus on the other careers. He’s defensive for most of the games (like mama niki taught him); he simply spends his time learning the arena and hunting for food. He only kills two tributes through the games, one he was trying to save from the river but died (it counted as a kill because the capital decided so), and the final tribute who thought they won until Mr. Gamers killed them.

## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** Not very long. A day or so. He didn’t get very injured so :/ Well. okay. He is emotionally distraught that the person he tried to save died and the capital counted it as a kill. But he is not physically injured.

**Relationship with Mentor:** Niki’s very proud of him for winning without going on a murder spree. Foolish is very grateful for Niki’s advice. Niki starts to become a mother figure for Foolish.

**Costuming:** Shark and strength branding continue, along with new egyptian god and “immortal” branding. Plays up the fact that most people thought he was dead and he was NOT. also plays into the arena being egypt to turn him into like a,,, shark-headed egyptian god of life and death (or battle and strength i cant decide)

**Public Reception:** people generally like him, but its not a huge thing bc most people thought he was going to win anyway. D4 likes him for using the river and they recognize that he was trying to save that tribute despite the capital saying otherwise. The district of the tribute he tried to save also likes him now. I have not thought of what district it could be. Perhaps 11 or 7 for the Boys. His games were not super eventful except for the end so he’s kinda a lackluster victor if that makes any sense. He is okay with this.
