# jschlatt - 2

## Personal Information
**Name:** Schlatt

**Birth Date:** September 10, -14

**Age at Victory:** 16

**District:** [12](../../Worldbuilding/Districts/district12.md)

**Volunteer:** No

**Pre-Games:** Especially this early, life in Twelve is not something to envy. He’s mostly on his own, supports himself by working as a janitor in the Justice Building. Not much going for this guy - sixteen and he already has an alcohol dependency and several deficiencies!

## Introduction Week
**Reaping:** Miserable affair, just like it was last year. No one expects things to change.

**Costuming:** Just a plain suit and tie, with some color thrown in for flair.

**Public Reception:** They are given two days to prepare. Interviews are live this year. Schlatt makes the most of his interview, selling himself much higher and brasher than he feels is accurate. He refuses to go unnoticed. If he’s going to die, at the very least they’re going to remember him.

## The Arena
The location and events are mostly the same as last year, but obstacles such as ruins and ditches are added to the Colosseum floor to increase excitement and difficulty. 

## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** One day

**Costuming:** Suit and tie, but much more in line with the Capitol fashions. The persona from his interview carries over into how they portray him after the games.

**Public Reception:** The Capitol thinks he’s arrogant, but some people adore the out-there persona he conjured up for their entertainment. The Districts are disgusted by him.

## The Tower
**Relationship with District:** Twelve completely disowns him. They treat him as dead, mourning the boy that left Twelve, and refusing to acknowledge the person he is now.

**Relationship with Floormates: 
- [Phil](Philza.md): Tries to out-tough Phil at first, but he can’t keep it up forever and Phil is also not making it easy to be aggressive. He tries to hide, but they’re the only two in the Tower at first and they both get lonely. They come to a silent mutual understanding that grows into a friendship over time, with the inclusion of more people. Schlatt and Phil are often each others’ only confidants.
- [Niki](Nihachu.md): Niki scares him, which he will not admit. Her honesty about how the Games affected her mindset and worldview is foreign to him, and she makes him question whether or not he has to keep up his persona at all times, or if it’s something that can be used only when needed.
- [Vikk](Vikkstar.md): 
- [Callahan](Callahan.md): not the closest at first, mostly bc Schlatt doesn’t like kids + the substance issues aren't healthy for a kid to see and he knows that from experience (cough cough Niki). Later on they bond because they can sit in silence together. Callahan also teaches him to sign which he uses to joke with Callahan and also insult people.
- [Lazar](LazarBeam.md): 
- [Ponk](Ponk.md): 
- [Punz](Punz.md): 
- [Sam](awesamdude.md): 

**Interfloor Relationships:
- [Charlie](../floor1/Slimecicle) and [Connor](../floor1/ConnorEatsPants): he sees this one kid refuse to be named and branded for the games and sees this other kid insult the president live on air and decides to take them under his wing, so to speak
- [Wilbur](../floor2/WilburSoot): 

**Personal Development:** lmao. LMAO

## As of Year 28
**Mentee:** [Quackity](../floor2/Quackity)

**Costuming:** business suit and horns. Some “comical” yet artful fake alcohol stains in theme each event.

**Public Perception:**

**Current Arc/Issue:**
