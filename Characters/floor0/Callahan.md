# Callahan - 5

## Personal Information
Name: Callahan
Birth Date: January 19, -8
Age at Victory: 13
District: [[District 8]]
Volunteer: No
Pre-Games: Was already a quiet kid and good with animals. Very loved by his community.

## Introduction Week
Reaping: District 8’s silence is their rebellion. No one speaks up. Callahan doesn’t even utter a word during it.
Costuming: I think they probably lean into the whole ‘hey he’s quiet’ thing so i think they go like almost weird scarecrow false stitching stuff.
Training: Callahan goes mostly unnoticed in the Training Centre amongst the stronger, bigger, manual labor-centric District tributes. The Introduction is extended to be five days to allow for more time to plan and for people to get attached.
Public Reception: This year, interviews are revamped and made into a show. Philza begins to conduct the interviews in front of a live studio audience, and the questions are more in-depth and require more thought on the tributes’ part. District 8 loves him.

## The Arena
Animals are introduced into the Arena along with the tributes. Callahan is able to use this to his advantage, although the process of this Games is so long he begins to get hungry/dehydrated.

## Victory Tour
Recovery: Two/three days, healing wounds and recovering strength.
Costuming: antlers. They do like the whole like youth ™ thing. Think like they make him cherubic and youthful, maybe that's where he got the red nose from?
Public Reception: Not really favored. Capitol people don't like that he's so quiet but what can they do?

## The Tower
Relationship with District: Possibly the best out of everyone in the tower. D8 fucking loves him. For D8, silence is rebellion, and he’s doing the ultimate rebellion while being viewed as well behaved. He’s showing ultimate loyalty to his district and the capitol is fucking oblivious LOL.

Relationship with Floormates: great. He vibes. 
- Him and [[Philza]] are ultimate quiet rebellion bros and tower management bros besties. 
- [[jschlatt]] and him are good friends because they both just sit in silence with each other. 
- Him and [[Nihachu]] are besties. 
- Him and [[Vikkstar]] and [[LazarBeam]] spend a ton of time together bc they get left out a lot so established dynamic and friends. 
- [[Ponk]] and him compliment each other well, Callahan is usually tasked with “babysitting” him when Ponk gets in trouble. 
- [[Punz]] and Callahan is the only one that is kinda iffy bc Punz is so loyalist and Callahan’s entire personality is unending rebellion, but they can vibe, mostly bc Punz doesn’t fully realize how deep Callahan’s rebellion runs. 
- Callahan and [[awesamdude]] are also besties. Best bro’s in fact.

Interfloor Relationships: 
- close with connor and george and bad and skeppy and dream and sapnap. No other major notes. Friends with all. He's just cool i think

Personal Development: Callahan has taken a permanent vow of silence to prove that the Capitol cannot have everything. He’s still seen as a very safe albeit boring victor, but he’s chaotic as shit. Struggles with future d8 tributes talking and not providing their silence, but understands after connor wins that talking is now necessary for d8 ppl to win. It still does leak over a bit into personal convos with Connor and George (marble incident who)(haha not kidding tho). There will never be an arc where he speaks unless it's just a fake voice pre-recorded like Callahan has actually done.

## As of Year 28
Mentee: [[ConnorEatsPants]]
Costuming:  The antlers are a big thing. They can be fake or small or real or huge or decorated. The antlers set the vibe for the rest of the fit ™. Probably gets a red nose, either the clown kind or just a fuckton of blush. He has a reindeer onesie or a blue onesie. His main color vibe is earthy brown and bright blue. He has the black shoes and sometimes they make them look like hooves <3. He also gets like. Some weird gloves where it's all skin toned except it's like brown soft fur to the first like. What's the word. phalange
Public Perception: who’s this man lol. He falls off pretty quick I would say. I think there are probably some Callahan fans but that's usually bc of D8 influence/old ppl in the family influence. He gets like intermediate waves of fans as he makes the funny jokes in the minecraft server but they usually get like bored of him pretty quick
Current Arc/Issue: doesn't know what to make of the new guy. Wants to be able to have a microwave in his room.

## Other 
here is a snippet to illustrate the d8 opinion 
“callahan is silent at every single district tour, to mixed reactions. but d8 doesn't utter a single sound, save for the senator and mayor but both bend away from the mic and speakers accidentally malfunction. even the birds around have fallen silent. the capitol spins this. "Callahan is saying that you aren't worth his voice. He only answers to the capitol." but d8 sees and they know. they know. Callahan is saying that they are worth his silence. they are worth this perpetual act of defiance”. 
Also he teaches all of them sign language and he’s best buddy with all the avoxes. He’s on the angel list for the floor visitation office. He knows all the secret hidey holes and is often where he shouldn't be. Tower cryptid. Intimidating as shit but he wears a onesie like all the time. Definitely commands respect like a lot of intimidating victors but he chills people out so much that they don't notice. He helps out with more shy victors during galas just cause they can just sign with him and won’t have to talk. Comforts George a lot during his year i think.
another snippet “i just think for the first few months while george is feeling the loneliness the most callahan just does. chaotic shit to make george laugh and also so george can settle into making funny heehee content”. I feel like he’s a good safe spot during galas and events and the people who hang around him at galas are chill/apathetic/ignore people who come to talk with Callahan. If he has a title/slogan it's “The Victor of The Voiceless.” tubbo 100% has a conspiracy theory board.
