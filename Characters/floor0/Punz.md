## Introduction Week
Reaping:
Costuming: 
Training: 
Public Reception:  Punz is not as favored as others and so Punz latches onto the most popular tribute early on, promising to protect them and let them win, so long as the tribute promised to send at least some money to 2. Punz gets viewed as a bodyguard.

## The Arena
This year, artificial weather is introduced. It rains/storms most of the time, with the severity increasing as time goes on. Punz is struck by lightning, but survives relatively unharmed. Punz ends up betraying the person he promised to protect, stating that another tribute offered him more. (idk if this is true or not just an idea)

## Victory Tour
Recovery: 
Costuming: mercenary
Public Reception: 

## The Tower
Relationship with District:

Relationship with Floormates:
- Callahan: Punz is either oblivious or willfully ignorant to the fact that Callahan is rebellious. Thereâ€™s some weird tension over political ideals and sometimes they get borderline vicious with each other over small stuff but they care about each other a lot. Just a bootlicker and a rebel being friends vibes.

Interfloor Relationships: 
- [[DreamWasTaken]]: there is some sort of betrayal here. Idk what but it hurts both but they are patching things over slowly in 28

Personal Development: starts off wanting peace and actively working to keep the peace. He then gets bored and starts fighting with Ponk more. They are good friends still, just doing small spats over stuff.

## As of Year 28
Mentee: [[Antfrost]]
Costuming: he gets mercenary branding, has the hoodie and the chain and those cool techwear cargo pants
Public Perception:
Current Arc/Issue: Struggling with how stagnant his life has become and is now actively wishing for more chaos
