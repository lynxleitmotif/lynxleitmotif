## The Arena
The landscape is desert-like, sandy with little plant cover and mountains, like North Dakota. This year, genetically engineered monsters called Mutts are introduced. They are slow, green, humanoid-esque creatures that explode if a tribute is within range. Sam is able to adapt to them the fastest, and is able to use them to his advantage.

**Relationship with Floormates:** 
- [Callahan](Callahan.md): besties, Sam starts off pretty unnoticed in his career and then he pops off. Sort of trades spots with Vikkstar almost. They chill a lot, talk a lot about new funny hidey holes in the tower, talk about locking dream up (/hj)(nah but fr when they both get tired of Dream, Callahan drags him somewhere and then Sam stands guard. It's the only fun thing to do sometimes on shoot days).
