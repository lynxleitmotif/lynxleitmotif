# Philza - 1

## Personal Information
**Name:** Phil

**Birth Date:** March 1, -17

**Age at Victory:** 18

**District:** [9](https://github.com/lynxleitmotif/lynxleitmotif/Worldbuilding/Districts/district9.md)

**Volunteer:** Yes (not even i volunteer as tribute just “me instead, take me instead”)

**Pre-Games:** Contributing member of society, helped with reconstruction after the rebellion ended. He is well-liked and close with his community.

## Introduction Week
**Reaping:** Demands to be sent in the place of the younger chosen tribute.

**Costuming:** General green color scheme to match the fields of Nine, simple outfit to mirror the “simplicity” of being from a district.

**Introduction Day:** Tributes are dressed up nicely and basically introduced in a pre-recorded interview, with the interviewer off-camera. Arena Names are announced here.

**Public Reception:** Phil is one of the oldest tributes and one of the stronger ones. His District is worried for his safety and ashamed at the way the Capitol parades him around. He is widely regarded as a likely Victor by the audience.

## The Arena
Gladiatorial arena with spectators in the stands. There are various weapons scattered around the floor, and the fight lasts around an hour.

## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** One day

**Costuming:** A darker green, nicer fabric and designs - he’s Capitol now. Nothing extravagant yet, but the Angel of Death branding can find its roots here.

**Public Reception:** Most of the Capitol loves him, but the Districts have mixed feelings about him. They are still aware that this isn’t a situation where blame can be placed on Phil, but at the same time his actions in the arena were his. People from everywhere have wildly differing opinions this year, as it is the first of its kind and no one really knows what to think of it all.

## The Tower
**Relationship with District:** Nine is sad to see what he’s done and everything he has to do. They don’t disown him, but they are disappointed and wary of him. He doesn’t feel at home among them anymore, but he participates in their traditions as best as he can.
