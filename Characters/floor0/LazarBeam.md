# LazarBeam - 6

## Personal Information
Name: Lazar/Lannan
Birth Date: December 14, -11
Age at Victory: 16
District: [[District 5]]
Volunteer: No
Token: Though it isn’t allowed, he manages to smuggle in a wire bracelet. 
Pre-Games: normal guy. Good with electricity and conduction

## Introduction Week
Reaping: nearly every person in the audience tap a message for him. “w-i-n”
Costuming: they just dress him in normal clothes but they layer LED lights on him
Training: He doesn’t excel in the physical aspects, but does well enough to go untargeted.
Public Reception: The Introduction is extended to its final length, a week. This is the first inclusion of the Naming Ceremony. Lazar is one of the few to pick more unconventional names, a thing which is so far considered to be a disadvantage. He’s more mature than most other tributes so he’s favored by the odds, and he’s entertaining enough that the Capitol pays attention to him.

## The Arena
The animals in the Arena this year are birds, rather than ground animals. In the initial rush, his leg is damaged, forcing him to defend using the surroundings instead of fighting. Lazar lasts until the final two, and manages to win the battle despite his injury because the birds attack the other tribute, while Lazar has learned what makes them attack and what they like. The birds stay away from bright colors which Lazar wears heavily.

## Victory Tour
Recovery: A week, his leg is permanently damaged due to not receiving medical care in time.
Costuming: BRIGHT COLORS!!! + slight old man vibes
Public Reception: they liked his jokes amidst all the other stuff. Well needed comedic relief. Not the most loved but the capitol likes him a good bit

## The Tower
Relationship with District: 5 appreciates him for making the best out of the arena situation. He usually has morse code lights in all his streams with status updates and also like “sending money soon” and “love 5” all that stuff. 5 sort of aides in forgetting him. Which stings

Relationship with Floormates: invisible trio
- [[Callahan]]: Callahan helps him cope with getting forgotten and they vibe a lot. They have a pretty close dynamic and they both teach each other a new way to communicate
- [[Vikkstar]]: they are besties. Old man vibes together. They lean on each other a lot (physically and metaphorically). He's a little jealous of vikkstars fame but realizes pretty quickly that vikkstars fame is not good.

Interfloor Relationships: 
- has hung out with [[TommyInnit]] at least once. 
- Him and [[ConnorEatsPants]] are surprisingly close. They play Fortnite a lot.

Personal Development: struggles with aging very badly because of his branding but comes to terms with it (mostly). Struggles with being forgotten but gets help from Callahan with it. Pretty homesick often i would say.

## As of Year 28
Costuming: gingerbread man + old man. Thinking at least one year he’s in this like large crumbling gingerman shell that peels off to be just a really bright shirt and pants
Public Perception: popular amongst fornite guys. Otherwise who’s this man lol?
Current Arc/Issue: his bad leg is getting worse and is grappling with the thought that he might have to actually use a cane when not in costume. “in year 28, it becomes apparent that using a cane is a good idea for him but he struggles with it bc even though it hurts to not use one, he still views it as a part of his persona and is trying to reject it/not let it into his personal life”

## Other 
He’s the first to be forgotten. Also snippet “i'm thinking maybe in the arena there's a lot of birds and shit. so he dons the really bright red white and blue and green to scare off the birds and he does the whole joking 'get off my lawn' bit”. He named himself after the tool that his family used to communicate in morse code. I think there’s a bit of trauma from the birds, so he always wears at least one brightly colored thing. (the invisible trio make him a very bright necklace that he wears every single day alongside his wire bracelet)
