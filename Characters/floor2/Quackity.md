# Quackity - 29

## Personal Information
**Name:** Quackity

**Birth Date:** December 28, 10

**Age at Victory:** 18

**District:** [12](../../Worldbuilding/Districts/district12.md)

**Career:** No

**Volunteer:** No

**Mentor:** [jschlatt](../floor0/jschlatt.md)

**Token:** Hat 

**Pre-Games:** Flies under the radar, not well off but manages to keep his head above water, mostly independent, has worked in the mines for two years

## Introduction Week
**Reaping:** The only outstanding thing about it is that he trips on the way up to the stage

**Relationship with Mentor:** He thinks Schlatt is a drunkard who doesn’t care about anything anymore, and he’s half right. Schlatt is sick of the routine by now, but Quackity puts up such a fight to get his attention that he decides to give a shit again. It pays off, Quackity is charming and the audience loves him, and Schlatt actually attempts to get sponsors for him so he has more than just his own strength when it comes time for survival. For the first time in a while District 12 is getting attention, and Schlatt and Quackity have a mutual understanding that they’re both working hard for what they want; Schlatt, to finally stop being in the relative spotlight, and for Quackity, to survive.

**Costuming:** Coal mine canary; yellow wings, soot/dirt-streaked appearance, ratty clothes

**Training Score/Total Tributes:** 6/12; he’s been working in the mines for two years, he has some strength to his exuberance. He doesn’t know how to use it, though.

**Public Reception:** The Capitol is intrigued by him, they enjoy seeing him struggle to make something of himself, most see him as an underdog. He entertains them well, but not many are expecting him to win.

## The Arena
Spends most of his time hiding at the start, is forced to fight for himself slowly until suddenly he’s the last one standing, good at taking care of his wounds and rationing out the food and water he has, plays a little bit of the long game. Receives his signature eye scar in the last battle.

## Victory Tour
**Recovery:** Two days

**Relationship with Mentor:** There’s a bit of gratitude and pity coming from Schlatt, more genuine connection now that he can see an end in sight. Quackity does not get any real advice from him as Schlatt’s environment was very different from the environment Q is going into now, but Quackity respects Schlatt a little more now that he knows what being a Victor entails. Quackity sees Schlatt as something he’s leaving behind, something to call on in a last resort, but he’s on his own now and has to fight this new battle by himself. 

**Costuming:** Casual wear is usually reminiscent of his Arena clothes, a navy tracksuit, and his signature hat. Formal wear includes some variation of his wings, hacked up or bedraggled but never the full, healthy-looking plumage it was before; in less formal cases, suspenders and a shit ton of jewelry, and in more formal cases, a suit that follows the same style as Schlatt’s formal wear.

**Public Reception:** Quackity is the tenth Victor on the floor, which means he functions as a pivoting point of sorts. The focus is on him for a while, but eventually he has to share the spotlight with leading into next year and the new decade. The public seems to forget that nobody wanted him to win and hails this as a well deserved victory against all odds. Schlatt’s businessman persona leaks into Quackity’s, along with the Las Nevadas-esque gambling with your life/power concept. Quackity is all bark and no bite, but he’s never forced to use the bite anymore so he can bark all he wants. The Capitol thinks he’s a wild card, rare in the way only a D12 can be. 

## The Tower
**Relationship with District:** Twelve is horrified by him, sees him as another traitor/sellout. Quackity doesn’t go home often.
